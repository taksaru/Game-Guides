Airy - Perfect Form | Normal: 99999HP x3  <br/> Hard: 134998HP x3 | N/A | N/A

Airy's Perfect Form is similar to her second form, except with way higher status, which makes this battle really difficult. Airy will usually go into default state, then Acedia and Zeta Flare in one turn, which can deal 4000 to 7000 damage to your entire party, this can be an instant game over. Another attack that you need to watch out for is her Slaughter ability, which hits randomly, and deals around 5000 damage on all targets or 9999 damage to the remaining allies standing. There is many tactics that you can use to avoid Airy's attacks. If you have a Salve-Maker in your party, you can compound Giant's Draft (BeastLiver + Dragon Fang) to have HP beyond 9999 to survive Airy's insane damage output. Another method would be relying on Spiritmaster's ward ability (Stillness). Valkyries High Jump Method. The High Jump method lets you cheese through any singular boss fights. All you have to do is equip someone in the party with Hasten World (Time Mage Level 14), and then set everyone to do High Jump on the very first turn, and press Y to set the game on auto. If your speed is quick enough, you should able to defeat Airy without getting a single scratch. If the High Jump method doesn't work, try equipping agility boosting items until it works. (Falcon Knife, Fox Tail or Hermes Shoes.)

It is recommended to go back to the save point after this battle.
