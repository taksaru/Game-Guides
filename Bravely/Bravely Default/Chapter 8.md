# Eternia Central Command - Boss Rush

Boss | Health | Stolen Item | Drop
--- | --- | --- | ---
Profiteur | Normal: 80000HP <br/> Hard: 134998HP | Turbo Ether <br/> Elixir | Turbo Ether <br/> Elixir
Einheria | Normal: 101500HP <br/> Hard: 141750HP | Turbo Ether <br/> Elixir | Turbo Ether <br/> Elixir
Jackal | Normal: 99999HP <br/> Hard: 128250HP | Turbo Ether <br/> Elixir | Turbo Ether

This battle is pretty rough. Profiteur uses Large BP drinks which will automatically give his teammates 3 BP. This will allow Jackal to spam his Godspeed Strike and with Einheria doing Crescent Moon. This means a swift death if you came unprepared. If you plan on winning this battle you need to find a way of getting rid of Profiteur immediately and then focus on the rest of his team. At this point of the game, you should able to cheese your way through with the High Jump method, if this boss gives you a massive headache.

Boss | Health | Stolen Item | Drop

Kamiizumi | Normal: 99999HP <br/> Hard: 134998HP | Turbo Ether <br/> Elixir | Turbo Ether <br/> Elixir
Kikyo | Normal: 90000HP <br/> Hard: 121500HP | Turbo Ether <br/> Elixir | Turbo Ether <br/> Elixir
Heinkel | Normal: 95000HP <br/> Hard: 128250HP | Turbo Ether <br/> Elixir | Turbo Ether
Holly | Normal: 85000HP <br/> Hard: 114750HP | Turbo Ether <br/> Elixir | Turbo Ether <br/> Elixir

This battle is very similar to the battle of the Black Blades in Starkfort. Except you don't have to deal with Barbarossa or Qada. The biggest annoyance would be Heinkel, as Heinkel would be protecting his allies, so you have to defeat Heinkel before you can deal any damage to the rest of their party. If you plan to use magic, Holly will cast reflect on their group which can prevent you from using magic on them. If you can defeat Heinkel, then you should focus on defeating Holly to remove their support unit. A method of dealing this group is to bring someone with Spiritmaster abilities and use Stillness, until the bosses is in negative BP,once they do, take that opportunity to strike

Boss | Health | Stolen Item | Drop

Alternis | Normal: 80000HP <br/> Hard: 108000HP | Turbo Ether <br/> Elixir | Turbo Ether <br/> Elixir
Barras | Normal: 99999HP <br/> Hard: 134998HP | Turbo Ether <br/> Elixir | Turbo Ether <br/> Elixir
Barbarossa | Normal: 95000HP <br/> Hard: 128250HP | Turbo Ether <br/> Elixir | Turbo Ether
Praline | Normal: 85000HP <br/> Hard: 114750HP | Turbo Ether <br/> Elixir | Turbo Ether <br/> Elixir

Another battle similar to the Black Blades in Starkfort. Except with the addition of Alternis. Just focus on taking out Praline first. Praline can raise the status of her party, and also their BP as well. If you don't remove Praline, it will become a liability for your success. When Praline is gone, you should focus on Barbarossa or Alternis. Barras should be last because of his invigorate skill which is fatal to the entire team.

Boss | Health | Stolen Item | Drop

Ominas | Normal: 90000HP <br/> Hard: 121500HP | Turbo Ether <br/> Elixir | Turbo Ether <br/> Elixir
Qada | Normal: 95000HP <br/> Hard: 128250HP | Turbo Ether <br/> Elixir | Turbo Ether
Yulyana | Normal: 99999HP <br/> Hard: 134998HP | Turbo Ether <br/> Elixir | Turbo Ether
Mephilia | Normal: 85000HP <br/> Hard: 114750HP | Elixir | Turbo Ether

This is probably the hardest boss battle in the game. The main key of winning this battle is that you need to get rid of Qada in one turn. If you cannot do that, then is no possibility of winning this battle. One of the main preparation you need to do for this battle is to have a Iceflame Shield equipped. Because this bosses here mainly specialize in Fire attacks. If you let Qada live, he will use an item that cause your party weak to fire and Mephilia's fire summon does 9999 to the whole party regardless of defense and the only way to survive this is to equip someone with Iceflame shield or a spiritmaster. If you playing on normal mode, you can get rid of Qada in one turn if you use a three pirates and use Amped Strike with Free Lunch from Swordmaster. The last party member which is most likely a support unit to attack Qada another 5000 this should get rid of Qada with in one turn. If you're playing on hard mode, you can get rid of Qada using the same method, by repeating the Free Lunch and Amped Strike combo and have then the rest of the party with mimic. Amped strike should easily let you output 9999 damage even with a shield. If that does not work then you need to use a spiritmaster to win this fight. Spiritmaster Stillness can nullify all damage taken, so if you timed your speed according, you can damage the enemy and put up stillness before the enemy strikes. If all else fails, then I suggest using an overpowered Friend Summon to get rid of Qada. Once you have removed Qada, the fight is pretty much won (if you been equipped with Iceflame Shields), and all the enemy does is fire attacks and if you dispel the reflect from Yulyana, they will even burn themselves with Firaga.

App-maker's note: **** THIS BOSS FIGHT

Boss | Health | Stolen Item | Drop
--- | --- | --- | ---
Victoria | Normal: 75000HP <br/> Hard: 101250HP | Turbo Ether <br/> Elixir | Turbo Ether
Khint | Normal: 95000HP <br/> Hard: 128250HP | Turbo Ether <br/> Elixir | Turbo Ether
Lord DeRosso | Normal: 99999HP <br/> Hard: 134998HP | Turbo Ether <br/> Elixir | Turbo Ether
Fiore DeRosa | Normal: 90000HP <br/> Hard: 114750HP | Turbo Ether <br/> Elixir | Turbo Ether

Before you fight this boss battle, you should have someone with Spiritmaster and another person with with Templar or Ninja abilities in your skill list. Fairy Ward is very useful on this battle and will protect you against Doom, and status ailments from Victoria. This group of bosses mostly focus on inflicting ailments against you. Having Rampart is useful for blocking hits from DeRosso and Khint. I suggest you get rid of DeRosa last as he is the most harmless one.

Boss | Health | Stolen Item | Drop
--- | --- | --- | ---
Braev | Normal: 99999HP <br/> Hard: 134998HP | Turbo Ether <br/> Elixir | Turbo Ether
Victor | Normal: 90000HP <br/> Hard: 121500HP | Turbo Ether <br/> Elixir | Turbo Ether
Artemia | Normal: 95000HP <br/> Hard: 128250HP | Turbo Ether <br/> Elixir | Turbo Ether
Khamer | Normal: 85000HP <br/> Hard: 114750HP | Turbo Ether <br/> Elixir | Turbo Ether

This is another tough battle, mainly because Khamer now spams meteor whichdoes random damage can wipe out your party instantly along with Artemia'sMultiburst. Best recommendation is to use a high damage group which is either| |Dark Knight with Spiritmaster, or Pirate and Swordmaster combo andimmediately get rid of Khamer and then focus on Artemia. If you are usingSpiritmaster, you should cast Spirit Ward to ward to nullify holy damage from| |Victor and Braev. Once you can get rid Artemia, the battle should be prettylaid back.
